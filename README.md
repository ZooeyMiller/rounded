A web app for recording and keeping track of your mood

## What?
A PWA for people who don't have much time, but want to keep track of how they're feeling.

## Why?
I want to keep track of my mood and energy levels as the can vary quite a lot, and it's hard to tell how long ups/downs last, so having a record would be _really_ useful.
The apps on the market at the moment are some combination of:
* Too gamefied
* Too social-media-y
* native
* too feature heavy (I want something __very__ simple and easy to use)

It should be PWA so that it has a more _native_ feeling, and allow users to browse their past moods even when offline (though they will not be able to add new entries when offline)

## How?
We're using Elm and Tachyons (in combination with some custom CSS).

We're very focused on users, and luckily becuase I am the person with the problem beign solved by the app, it is easy to refer to a user's wants and needs.
This app will be iterated upon based on feedback received when we have a working version to put in the hands of users.
